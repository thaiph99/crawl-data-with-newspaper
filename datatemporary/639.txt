On the first day of the trip, it takes visitors three hours to travel from Hanoi to Loc Binh District, Lang Son. They can have lunch there before going to the foot of Phia Po Mountain and starting their trek journey in the afternoon.. . At first, travelers will pass through dense forests on narrow paths skirting the roots of enormous trees and boulders. The following terrain is gentle hills, covered with low grass.. . In fall, the hill grass turns a bright yellow. In spring and winter, the mountains are always misty. Currently, in April, the Phia Po mountain valleys are covered with white clouds, making the view even more mystic.
