HCMC plans to vaccinate over 56,200 medical workers and airport employees against Covid-19 this month, its Center for Disease Control said.. . Some 45,000 are medical workers who will get their first shot and 2,000 are personnel working in Tan Son Nhat Airport who have direct contact with passengers.. . The remaining 9,200 are medical workers who have already got their first shot.. . Nguyen Tan Binh, director of the city Department of Health, said there are around 60,000 healthcare workers in the city, but since the AstraZeneca vaccine is scarce, those directly examining and treating patients would be prioritized.. . Nguyen Tri Dung, director of the CDC, said the second shots for people getting the vaccine now would be given before May 15.. . Vietnam is seeking 150 million doses of the vaccine to cover 75 percent of its population by next year.. . Side effects have been rare so far, and, besides, everyone has recovered fully.
