The cable-stayed bridge, with its main tower rising 113 meters and leaning towards Thu Thiem, is supposed to become an architectural highlight on the river with an artistic lighting design. Once complete, it will help connect the downtown HCMC with the Thu Thiem New Urban Area and ease traffic congestion at the intersections of Ton Duc Thang-Nguyen Huu Canh streets and Ton Duc Thang-Le Thanh Ton streets in District 1.. . However, aside from the land clearance roadblock, the project has also faced issues in verifying both project volume and value with investor Dai Quang Minh Real Estate Investment JSC. For now, related agencies and departments are negotiating the issues with the investor, as directed by the Department of Transport last month.
